    <p> <em>Writing.</em> Whether you’re obsessed with it, disillusioned with it, or maybe both, you’ve come to the right place. </p>

    <p>If you’re sifting through a draft of your latest novel, reworking a think piece to post on your Substack, polishing a manuscript before submitting it for publication, or anywhere in between, I can provide detailed and actionable feedback to bring out the best in your work while preserving your voice as a writer.</p>

    <p>Over the past six years, I’ve studied English and Spanish linguistics and literature, screenwriting, and literary translation at Loyola Marymount University and the University of Georgia. Throughout this time, I’ve acquired more than four years of experience tutoring and teaching writing at the college level. I’ve also worked in a variety of editorial roles in academic and non-academic publishing, including Co-Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://www.atticsaltlmu.com/">Attic Salt</a> and intern at <a href="https://www.dzancbooks.org/">Dzanc Books</a>.</p>

    <p>Some of the services I provide are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Developmental editing </li>
        <li> Substantive editing </li>
        <li> Copyediting </li>
    </ul>

    <p>More information about my background and professional experience can be found on my <a href="/resume.html">Resume</a> page.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about how I can help you achieve your writing goals, or if you’re ready to get down to brass tacks and start collaborating, don’t hesitate to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
